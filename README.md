jquery-responsive-image
=======================

A very simple jQuery plugin to force images to truly responsive. I wrote jquery plugin primarily this because WYSIWYG editors can add inline width/height styles or width/height attributes to images which can override some CSS approaches.  When using a CMS with non technical content writers this plugin can come in handy.
